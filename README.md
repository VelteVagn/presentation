# Slides

This is a tiny Python project with purpose of using the terminal as a simple presentation/slideshow tool. At the moment, all text is hardcoded into the program, but this will be altered for easier use. 

## Notes

As the terminal is strictly text based, so will any presentation be, with the exception of text art like ASCII art, naturally.
